## Detailed Description
**Say goodbye to tab-hoarding stress.**

Are you a "tab-hoarder"? Do you find yourself clicking through dozens of tiny favicons trying to find 그 one document or video?

**TabZF** is a lightweight, privacy-focused extension that adds a powerful "Spotlight Search" capability to your Chrome tabs. Built for speed and productivity, it allows you to find any tab by typing just a few characters of its title or URL.

### 🚀 Key Features:
- **Lightning-Fast Fuzzy Search**: Find tabs even if you misspell them or only remember a part of the URL.
- **Smart Sorting**: 
  - **Recent**: See your most recently used tabs first.
  - **Order**: View tabs in the order they appear in your window.
  - **Alphabetical**: Keep things organized by title.
- **Keyboard Optimized**: Navigate with `ArrowKeys` and hit `Enter` to switch. Set a custom keyboard shortcut (like `Alt+F`) to trigger search instantly.
- **Clean Aesthetic**: A modern, glassmorphic UI that doesn't distract.

### 🔒 Privacy First:
- **Zero Tracking**: No data ever leaves your computer.
- **Local Execution**: All searching happens inside your browser.
- **Minimal Permissions**: We only ask for the permissions needed to list your tabs.

### ⌨️ Pro-Tip:
Go to `chrome://extensions/shortcuts` after installing and set a simple shortcut (e.g., `Ctrl+Space` or `Alt+K`) to open TabZF from anywhere!
