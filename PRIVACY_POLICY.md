# Privacy Policy for TabZF

**Last Updated: January 20, 2026**

TabZF ("the Extension") is committed to protecting your privacy. This Privacy Policy explains how we handle your information.

## 1. No Data Collection
TabZF operates entirely on your local machine. 
- We **do not** collect, store, or transmit any personal data.
- We **do not** track your browsing history or search queries.
- We **do not** use cookies or any third-party tracking services.

## 2. Permissions and Data Usage
The Extension requires the following permissions to function:
- **`tabs`**: Used solely to retrieve the list of your currently open tabs so you can search and switch between them. This data remains in your browser's memory and is never saved or sent elsewhere.
- **`storage`**: Used to save your UI preferences (such as your preferred sort order) locally in your browser.

## 3. Third-Party Services
TabZF does not communicate with any third-party servers. All fuzzy matching logic (Fuse.js) is bundled within the Extension and executed locally.

## 4. Security
Since no data is collected or transmitted, there is no risk of your data being intercepted or sold to third parties.

## 5. Contact
If you have any questions about this Privacy Policy, you can reach out via the GitHub repository where this project is hosted.
